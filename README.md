# PlayingWithCards
This is my project for ChiPy's python language mentorship program. The goal of
my project is to use machine learning to "solve" a simplified version of Magic
the Gathering, first trying it out on specific game based puzzles and then
testing it on full versions of the game.

The game I will start of working with is playable by running the gamep3.py file
in python 3. You play "l"s as resources to summon creatures represented as
numbers in order to attack and take your opponent's life points from 20 to 0.

I will update as make progress.
