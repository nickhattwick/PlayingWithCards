# PlayingWithCards
This is my project for ChiPy's python language mentorship program. The goal of
my project is to use machine learning to "solve" a simplified version of Magic
the Gathering. This all runs in Python3.

To play the simplified version of the game, run humangame.py.

To have the learning computer player play a game against an autopilot computer,
run rungame.py to create a new results.json, followed by parsing.py which will
update parsed.json which is referenced by the learning computer.

I will update as make progress.
