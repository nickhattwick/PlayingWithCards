# PlayingWithCards
The purpose of this project started as a desire to use machine learning to try
the card game Magic: the Gathering. I'll be starting a bit smaller, first trying
it out on a very simplified version.

The game I will start of working with is playable by running the gamep3.py file
in python 3.
